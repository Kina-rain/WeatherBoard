# WeatherBoard

This Weather Project was to build a website that has a local and searchable weather information using an API key.

I created an application that uses a users geolocation to get the users current location and allows them to search for weather in other 

locations. I also added a 5 day weather forecast for Baltimore. A UV index was added but was unable to keep a functioning API key.
